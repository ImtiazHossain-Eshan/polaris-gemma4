/**
 * Integration registry — the honest catalog.
 *
 * Statuses are real:
 *   - "available"      → working connect flow exists right now
 *                        (Codeforces public API, GitHub public/PAT import)
 *   - "requires_setup" → full OAuth flow is scaffolded server-side but the
 *                        operator hasn't added client credentials yet
 *                        (Google Calendar/Drive, Facebook). The UI says so.
 *   - "coming_soon"    → no reliable API/import path today; no Connect button
 *   - "connected" / "syncing" / "error" / "revoked" → per-user runtime states
 *
 * No fake Connect buttons anywhere.
