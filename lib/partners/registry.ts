/**
 * Partner Marketplace registry — the honest catalog.
 *
 * Offer types are real:
 *   - free_student_benefit   → official student programs (GitHub Pack, Notion
 *                              Education, JetBrains…) with official source URLs
 *   - curated_no_commission  → genuinely useful tools we recommend with ZERO
 *                              commission, clearly labeled
 *   - official_student_offer → an official discount published by the vendor
 *   - affiliate / referral   → supported by the model, but NONE are active —
 *                              Polaris has no affiliate deals yet and we don't
 *                              fake codes or links
 *   - coming_soon            → partnerships we want but don't have; request
 *                              buttons, no fake discounts
 *
 * Every visible offer carries sourceUrl + lastVerifiedAt. No invented codes,
 * discounts, or commission terms anywhere.
