 * Client-safe plan/feature logic. No server-only imports (no env, no db),
 * so this can be used in both client components and server code.
 *
 * FEATURE_ACCESS is the central feature-access map: every gated surface
 * declares its required plan, whether it's actually implemented, where it
 * lives, and what the upgrade prompt should say. The billing catalog
 * (lib/billing/plans.ts) is the matching source of truth for what each
 * plan ADVERTISES — the two are audited together (docs/PLAN_VERIFICATION.md).
