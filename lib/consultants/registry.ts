/**
 * Consultants & Community — registry layer.

 * Service taxonomy + the founding-cohort consultant seed. Profiles here are
 * upserted into the `consultants` collection on first access; verification
 * status is real data (only Polaris admins flip `verified`/`featured`), and
 * ratings are NEVER seeded — they aggregate from real reviews only, so a
 * new consultant honestly shows "New on Polaris" instead of invented stars.
 *
 * Marketplace independence: this feature is available to every plan
 * (free/pro/elite). Polaris adds a transparent 10% platform fee on paid
 * bookings — disclosed everywhere a price is shown.
