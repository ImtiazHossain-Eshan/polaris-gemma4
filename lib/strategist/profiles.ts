/**
 * Strategist mode profiles.
 *
 * Each "mode" layers a tone + behavior on top of the personalized base
 * prompt (profile + memory + KB). The orchestrator picks one by user
 * preference or by router decision (e.g. "research" mode prefers a model
 * with web search + reasoning).
 *
 * Modes:
 *   • general   — friendly co-pilot, balanced
 *   • research  — deep multi-source synthesis, prefers web search
 *   • study     — explainer mode, step-by-step, pedagogically clear
 *   • coding    — code-first, syntax + runnable snippets
